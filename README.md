Welcome to the GitHub repository on documenting REST APIs for the GitHub wiki!

The example is for adding toppings to a pizza.
This is similar to the traditional shopping cart but more flavorable.

There is nothing to build or run in this repository:<br/>
_The wiki markdown is the source code._

You want to go to the **wiki pages** which is the purpose of this project:
[Home wiki page](//github.com/binkley/wiki-docs/wiki).
For any GitHub project, it's in the GitHub top bar as "ðŸ“– Wiki" [when
enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis).

## Extras

This repository includes the [`wiki-to-pdf.sh`] script and corresponding
GitHub workflow in CI.
This is **experimental** and used to test out wiki-to-PDF generation.
You should not use this unless you are curious until it is promoted to
production-worthy.
